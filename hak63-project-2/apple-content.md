## Introduction
The Ithaca Apple Harvest Festival is an annual festival held in downtown Ithaca. The festival hosts local farmers and produce, as well as freshly baked foods, live stage performances, and fun for anyone simply needing a break.

## What can I do there?
- Apple Fest is a place where you can come eat apple and non-apple related foods, watch live performances, or even just sit and soak in the relaxing and stress-free atmosphere.
- Some notable things to try include: apple cider donuts, buffalo chicken mac and cheese, and apple cider
- If you finish up early at Apple Fest, you can even stay in the Commons and go shopping! You're already there, so why not? And, if you're there as Apple Fest closes, you're also just in time for dinner! Ithaca Commons has many restaurants and other places to eat, if you aren't already full of Apple Fest related foods.
