# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?

- Work cooperatively with each other
- Voice conflict out loud
- Do assigned workload

2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)

- Respond within 24 hours to the group chat
- Be polite and open to new ideas

3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?

- Communication through GroupMe
- Meet in person once a week or once every two weeks

4. How will we communicate and work with our client?

- Meet with the client physically
- Exchange contact information so that if any questions arise between scheduled meetings, we can ask them right away

5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.

- Each team member will do at least 2 pages, and we will try to work together on the interactivity elements

Homepage, 660 Stewart Ave, Whitby - Angela
Watermargin, Wait Ave - Ben
Wait Terrace, Triphammer, Cayuga Lodge - Hanna
Wari, Von Cramm - Amal

We will work together on the Events and Photo gallery page

Each team member will submit one user testing. 


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?

- To keep each other accountable: message each other when the due date is coming and they have not done any work yet
- To a team member who doesn't appear to be contributing equally: message or talk to them directly and politely let them know what the issue is
- To a team member that fails to deliver what was promised: let them know that not doing what was promised is not okay, and urge them to do the work in the future

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?

- If many disagreements ensue, we will either message each other immediately so that conflicts aren't hidden, or we will meet more than the stated time to see if we can solve any problems

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?

- Revisit when necessary and when fundamental changes to the original website plan are made, to determine more specific roles

9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

- After each milestone, take a break to celebrate our accomplishments.


## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
