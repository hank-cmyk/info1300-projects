    <h4> Why I chose Information Science and Creative Writing:</h4>

    <p>
    Information Science is something that I hadn't heard of until last semester. But, after reading more about the different concentrations I could focus on, I found out about UX Design. This peaked my interest, especially seeing as I'd been wanting to do something more on the creative side with computers. However, I knew that I wanted to minor in Creative Writing from the beginning. I grew up reading a lot of books, and began writing for fun towards the end of high school and most of freshman year. It was a way I could create my own worlds and funnel my wayward imagination into a concrete place.
